# Simple Autoencoder for Image Reconstruction

This repository demonstrates the implementation of a simple autoencoder using TensorFlow and Keras on the MNIST dataset. Below is a detailed description of the implementation:

## Overview

### 1. Importing Related Libraries

The necessary libraries are imported, including TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib for visualization, and NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

### 2. Loading and Preprocessing MNIST Dataset

The MNIST dataset is loaded using Keras and preprocessed by normalizing pixel values to the range [0, 1]. The shapes of the training and testing datasets are displayed to provide an overview of the data dimensions.

### 3. Autoencoder Model Definition

#### Class: `SimpleAutoencoder`

The `SimpleAutoencoder` class is defined as a subclass of `tf.keras.Model`. It consists of two main parts:
- **Encoder**: Defined using a `Sequential` model within the `encoder` attribute, which flattens the input data and applies a dense layer with ReLU activation to reduce the data into a latent space of specified dimensions (`latent_dimensions`).
- **Decoder**: Defined using another `Sequential` model within the `decoder` attribute, which takes the encoded data and passes it through a dense layer with sigmoid activation, followed by reshaping to reconstruct the original data shape.

#### Method: `call`

The `call` method overrides the standard forward pass method, defining how input data flows through the autoencoder. It encodes input data using the encoder and decodes the encoded data using the decoder to reconstruct the input data.

### 4. Model Compilation and Training

The autoencoder model (`simple_autoencoder`) is compiled using the Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function. It is trained on the training dataset (`x_train`) for a specified number of epochs with the goal of minimizing reconstruction error.

### 5. Evaluation and Reconstruction

After training, the autoencoder is used to encode and decode images from the testing dataset (`x_test`). The reconstructed images (`decoded_imgs`) are compared visually with the original images to assess the performance of the autoencoder in reconstructing digit images.

## Conclusion

This README.md provides a detailed overview of implementing a simple autoencoder using TensorFlow and Keras on the MNIST dataset. It covers the model architecture, training process, and visualization of reconstructed images. This implementation serves as a foundational example for understanding autoencoder concepts and applications in image reconstruction tasks.
